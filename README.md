# SUI ZKLogin + Enoki

ZKLogin implementation using Mysten Labs' Enoki service for user's salt management and prover service.

This template includes:
* ZKLogin using google
* Transferring SUI to wallet address
* Minting a sample NFT with and without using sponsored transaction.

Note: This implementation of sponsored transactions bypasses the current limitation of Enoki's service by supporting them through self-owned wallet.
