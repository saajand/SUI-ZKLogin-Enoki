# SUI ZKLogin + Enoki

ZKLogin implementation using Mysten Labs' Enoki service for user's salt management and prover service.

This template includes:

- ZKLogin using google
- Transferring SUI to wallet address
- Minting a sample NFT with and without using sponsored transaction.
- Support for sponsored transactions using private API from enoki, using a backend service.

Note: This implementation of sponsored transactions bypasses the current limitation of Enoki's service by supporting them through self-owned wallet.

Node versions: v18 and above for the frontend, v20 and above for the backend.
